## Pyrite
---
Pyrite is your next anti-phishing Discord bot for removing users who mimic popular Discord bots!

By default, this is done through matching a person's username or nickname to a name of a well known Discord bot, as defined [here](https://github.com/Pyrite-X/Bot-List).

Along with this, there is an included rule system, allowing you to remove any users from your server who may match that rule.

## Self Hosting
Although I would much appreciate if you use the hosted version instead, it is possible to self-host Pyrite!

Documentation on how to do this will be outlined in the future.
